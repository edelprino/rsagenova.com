**[Deep Water Solo First Ascents in Mallorca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbreQjA-1_s)** Deep water solo first ascents at Cala Magrana. A cave we found while searching for new lines. We could establish 6 new lines, from 6c to 8c. There is still potential for more routes.

**[Round One on PROJECT BIG - Jakob Schubert & Adam Ondra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td__pF4Ff2o)** Despite the many great and hard climbs in Flatanger, there had always been this special mystery around "Project Big". Adam Ondra had bolted it the same trip he bolted the climb that became "Silence", and although Adam himself considers it "the real line of the cave", it remained a project since.
When Adam invited Jakob to try "Project Big" together, it was an easy decision to join forces in aiming for the first ascent. Join in for some climbing wizardry, and see what it's like when two of the world's best push hard for the first ascent of THE unclimbed line in Flatanger.
